# This solution is to read and display csv files (sample file is included in repo)
this is developed in .net core 2.2, so to run this solution on local, .net core SDK 2.2 should be installed and IIS express.
no third party library is used to parse csv files. However TextParser is available in .ner core 3.0
I used Dependency injection for logging and I think static helper make more sense.
